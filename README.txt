Plugin for WSDL services protected using SAML WEB SSO Profile
=============================================================

Taverna's WSDL activity is compatible with different security mechanisms (Basic HTTP Auth, WS-Security, ...), but lacks of compatibility with web browser based mechanisms for federation, such as the SAML WEB SSO Profile. 

We have developed a plugin that helps accessing services protected within a federation. Concretely the SIR (TODO: ref) federation.
